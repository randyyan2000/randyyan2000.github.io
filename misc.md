## Madame von Meck
### 3/27/2022
---


You probably are at least vaguely familiar with Tchaikovsky (Nutcracker anyone?), but who you might not know is the woman was behind much of his composing career. Her name is Nadezhda von Meck, aka Madame von Meck. Von Meck was a rich Russian woman who lived in the 19th century. After the death of her husband, she pretty much completely withdrew from society (she even skipped the weddings of her children ðŸ˜¢) aside from going to music concerts. She was a fan of Tchaikovsky, and eventually slid into his DMs via good oldâ€™ fashioned pen and paper to commission new pieces. Eventually, von Meck and Tchaikovsky wrote over 1,200 letters to each other over 14 years! These werenâ€™t short paragraphs or anything either â€“ weâ€™re talking writing whole essays about their personal lives and sharing ideas about not just the music Tchaikovsky was composing, but their feelings and struggles too. 

They would eventually become great friends, with Madame von Meck paying Tchaikovsky a whopping 6,000 rubles yearly to support his work (more than 10 times the salary of a typical Russian civil worker at the time ðŸ¤‘). You can also probably imagine a bit of weird tension you might feel if you were Tchaikovsky at this time, being fully supported by one person, especially a person who never even met you in person, and Tchaikovsky definitely felt awkward about this. Nevertheless, itâ€™s safe to say that Madame von Meck played a enormous role in Tchaikovskyâ€™s life through both her writing and dollars, and we have her in large part to thank for many of the memorable pieces Tchaikovsky composed in the late 1800s. Tchaikovsky even dedicated his fourth symphony to her â€“ give it a listen if you get the chance ðŸ˜Š.
